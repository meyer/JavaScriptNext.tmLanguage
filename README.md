# JavaScript.tmLanguage
Better JavaScript language definition for TextMate and SublimeText. This builds on the language files commonly used and adds more fine grained matching and also includes new features from ECMAScript 6 like modules, succinct methods, arrow functions, classes, generators, and accessors (ES5).

## A note from ya boy @meyer

This fork has a few vital changes for TextMate 2 (thx @dhensche), but I donâ€™t guarantee that it will work. NO PROMISES.
